### Binding of Isaac

Of the things I've noticed within Binding of Isaac

#### Speed Running and Racing

- Generally Speed runners will reset until they find a (big) damage up item
- Additionally Map layout is extremely important from the perspective of a speed runners
- this however, enables extreme situations where a world record can be heavilly based off rng rather than off hand eye skill and adaptation to opportunities and obstacles at hand

##### Question
  - How do I promote hand eye skill as being primary to speed running
  - What opportunities and obstacles can I present that will allow a racing/speed runners to see their current run as decent

##### Obvious answers
  - Racing and Speed running benefit off of
    - Damage/Attack Speed up - If a player can clear a room faster, they can continue on faster
    - Speed up - If a player can move faster, back tracks and empty rooms can be handled faster
  - Racing and Speed running can benefit from
    - Health - This allows a player to be more aggressive if they have heavy duty short range damage items
    - Knowledge - Map Awareness allows a player to take the shortest possible route to the end. Without they are dependent luck to find the exit quickly and on memory when they take a bad path
    - Control - The more in control of their items, the less they are dependent on RNG to win/get a decent speed
  - Racing and Speed Running doesn't benenfit off of
    - RNG - This enables a more enjoyable experience however, RNG adds variation which may cause reduced time or added time that would be impossible to get again

##### Possble Solutions
  - RNG Seperation
    - Setup RNG, Event RNG, Nuance RNG
    - Setup RNG
      - What this allows is for a setup to be the exact same every time
      - Generally for tower/room setup
    - Event RNG
      - Events to be the same if taken in same order
      - Can be "patented"
      - Force a player to make bad decisions to get benefits later down the line
      - Allow a player to make good decisions to get bad things later down the line
    - Nuanced RNG
      - heavilly tied to time step and nearly unpredictable
      - Applied to Artifical Inteligence
      - Applied to Animations
  - Damage Up isn't absolutely necessary for high damage output
    - Grabs and throws more important
      - Momentum retaination (requires player input)
    - "Trading" of health more reliable than damage up?
