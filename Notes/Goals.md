# How does helping the Modder help me?
- When creating aspects of this game, I will likely have to create alot
- I am competing with
  - Binding of Isaac
  - Nuclear Throne
  - Risk of Rain
- My competition thrives off a multitude of items
  - This enables each run to be a unique experience
    - Sometimes its easy, other times difficult
  - This enables each run to have a risk reward aspect
    - Subpar now with the possibility of good synergy later
    - Sacrificing one resource to maximize another
- My competition thrives off a multitude of rooms
  - Some rooms are more difficult than others
  - Each room has their unique way of solving the problem

- Ideally rooms and items will be as simple as uploading a json file
  - Weapons are unique in that
    - They may create a projectile
      - Those projectiles may be overridden by other effects
      - Those projectiles' impacts may cause a buff
- Individuals can create a weapon simply by uploading a json file
- Individuals can easily reskin anything in the game

- Auras are unique in that
  - They may be a trigger
    - Those projectiles may be overridden by other effects
    - Those projectiles' impacts may cause a buff
