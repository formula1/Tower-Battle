# Goal

- Get to each boss faster than your opponent
- Kill the boss
- Get the upgrade
- Move On

# Thematically

- Drinks the Dragons Blood
- Looks for the strongest of foes to take what they own
- Once

# Time Wise

- Initially relatively weak with escalating pops
- Once Final Boss Defeated, acts as bully for rest of the game unless opponents goal is better

# Obstacles

- What you recieve from each boss May not be that great
- Fighting through each room may get harder and harder
- You must make sure your character can handle each boss

# Best Manner

- Ability to take take advantage of dumb AI
- Minimize number of hits necessary to kill the boss
- Maximize running speed and ability to find boss

# What it looks like

- Run around to find the boss
- Drive By Attack minions only to retain adrenaline (not to kill)
- Charge Up right outside
- Rush in and strike (Only one target necessary [generally])
- Attempt to lose aggro if necessary

# What I need to enable

- Drive by attacks that maximize adrenaline
- Ability to "Charge Up" an attack - And a manner to balance that
- Allow absurd cooldown to enable the attack to maximize strength
- Ensure the attack is dumb enough to be easily avoidable by sentient beings
- Have a Single Target Attack




# RPS

- Beats Bully since bully cannot keep up nearly the amount of adrenaline
- However, Bully can attempt to find the boss first and deny the peace
