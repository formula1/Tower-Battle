# Goal

- Beat as many minions as you need to until you find the gem
- It is possible your opponent found one before you
  - Now a goal is to steal it back
- Once all are found, the end is neigh

# Thematically

- Hungry Hand
- Searches for the peices knowing they will become the strongest
- The power is immence

# Time Wise

- Through minion defeats, can stay afloat metagame wise and small buffs
- Its mostly a sqrt root increase though
- Once all gemes are found, they are exponentially stronger


# Entertainment

- Its important to make sure that this style is still entertaining
- One way is to ensure they can
  - maximize aggro with a huge amount of minions
  - Kill them in one sweep
- Another way is to make it "electric" esque
  - They jump from enemy to enemy
  - Make small but important adjustments to avoid bullet hell
  - But most importantly they always look for opportunities to be productive
- In the mean time they can explore
- Something else is information
  - They may not find the peice they are looking for, but they may be able to find a clue
  - This will then force them to go up to that floor
  - Decimate it (hoping for another clue)
  - Then go to the nextFloor
- If a boss rush is linear time, this will take at worst 2 + length -3 + length -6
- If there are no clues, there is time complexity in...
  1) killing every minion on each floor
- This can be reduced by providing clues
  1) Which floor has it
  2) Which Minion has it
  3) Which Minion has next clue

What is a decent clue?
1. At first there are all paths possible
  - A single stone on 3 of (length) floors
2. Reducing Which Possible is a good start
  - Odd or Even?
  - Must be of a certain element (if a stone is held of the same, it can be skipped)
3. At first any minion on a single floor is possible
  - If each minion is unique looking, they are more easily identifiable
  - If the minions are organized, they are likely to be protecting it (the harder it is, the close you are)
  - else if they are Based off Alpha Status, Alpha likely has it
  - else if they are a trading types,

I'd prefer to make clues mathematic
- Like a rune on a wall that can only exist if pathway xy or z are true
- If pathway xy or z is true than there may be otherways to figure it out
