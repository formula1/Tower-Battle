# Goal

- If your opponent is a bully, you will be able to win every interaction with them
- This basically nullifies their goals


# Purpose

- This is for balancing/metagame reasons
- I want the bully strong, I want them worth picking
- However, I don't want it to completely take over the metagame
- This is the white to the bully's black
- Its meant to be at a disadvantage against all strategies except the bully
